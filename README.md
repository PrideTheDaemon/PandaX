# The work that remains

- [ ] Part I – Attack of the Configs
  - [x] Build the database
    - [x] design it
    - [x] put the script on git
  - [x] implement jpa
  - [x] implement security tokens
  - [ ] postman test for the general use case
- [ ] Part II – Revenge of the REST
  - [ ] plan routes
  - [ ] implement rest routes
    - [ ] there is more to do in this section but i have no idea on how to divide it

# Guidelines (trespassers will be shot)

- Never commit a non-functionnal feature on *master*
- Try to bundle one feature per commit 
- Always provide the postman test case for your REST route
